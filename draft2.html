    <p>UFO in the United States in 2016</p>

      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; Americans are obsessed with aliens. The concept of “flying saucers” has captured the American imagination
        since the 1940s and 1950s. This has been connected to their ideas about life on the Moon, canals on the Red
        planet and Martian civilisations. America’s fixation with flying saucers, aliens and UFOs is not limited to just films and literature. In
        September 2019, some 2 million people joined a Facebook event called <span class='important_text'>“Storm Area 51, They Can’t Stop All of
          Us”</span>. Area 51 is a heavily guarded Air Force facility in Southern Nevada that has been the subject of several
        conspiracy theories because of the secrecy it is shrouded in. Many Americans believe the government hid
        bodies of aliens and UFOs here, and held meetings with extraterrestrials (Gill, 2021).
<br> Moreover, The US government recently relesed an unclassified report of various types of unidintidied aerial phenomena (UAPs) - known in popular culture as unidentified flying objects (UFOs).
The Pentagon’s preliminary assessment is based on the review of 144 UAP reports involving observations made by military aviators between 2004 and 2021.
 <span class='important_text'>Of the 144 reports, the task force could only determine an explanation for one.</span>  The rest remain unexplained (Stieb & Danner, 2021). This spiked a new interest in UFOs.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;The dot map shows all the location of the sightings recorded in 2016. We can see that the most sightings were at the east and west coasts.
There are numerous reasons for that. One of them is bigger population in the areas. This factor is analised by other visualisations below.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite lack of concrete evidence to suggest extra-terrestrial explanations for aerial sightings, <span class='blue_text'>One-sixth</span> of Americans claimed they had <span class='blue_text'>personally witnessed something they
  thought was a UFO </span>, while <span class='blue_text'>40,000 Americans bought into alien protection insurance</span>, which offers customers monetary relief should a loved one get abducted by extra-terrestrial life.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;A poll in 1991 suggests that around 4 million Americans believe they've been abducted by aliens.

          <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;The heatmap shows the number of sightings per every hour by month in 2016.
          <br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Almost three-quarters of all UFO sighting reports in the United States occur <span class='important_text'>between 4 p.m. and midnight</span> and tend to <span class='blue_text'>peak between 9 and 10 p.m.</span> 
          <br> <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Defence and intelligence analysts lack sufficient data to determine the nature of mysterious flying objects observed by military pilots.
          Since 2004, there have been 144 reports UAPs with 143 still undetermined, but with no clear indications any of extra-terrestrial explanation for the sightings. 
          However, the U.S. military has claimed to not rule out the possibility entirely. There are five potential explanatory categories: airborne clutter, natural atmospheric 
          phenomena, US government or American industry developmental programs, foreign adversary systems and an "other" category.</p>

    <div class="blockY">
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;Of the states with the highest number of UFO sightings, <span class='light_blue'>California</span>, <span class='orange'>Florida</span>, <span class='blue_text'>Arizona</span> and Washington</span> respectively, 
        <span class='light_blue'>California</span>, <span class='orange'>Florida</span> and <span class='lightorange'>New York</span> <span class="important_text"> are the top four largest U.S. state populations</span> . This could partially explain the greater number of UAF sightings in those states, due to a greater audience witnessing the sight.
        In fact, the scatter plot on the right side displays the relationship between stae population and the number of sightings recorded in the stete in 2016.
        Indeed, <span class='red_text'>R-squared</span> equals <span class='red_text'>0.82</span>  implying a strong positive correlation between the variables.

    <div class="blockY">
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;According to a poll Gallup in 2019, nearly <span class='important_text'>two-thirds</span> of Americans believed that the US government had more
        knowledge on UFOs than they claim to disclose, while <span class='important_text'>one-third</span> believed that some apparent UFOs were actual
        sightings of alien spacecraft. Yet <span class='important_text'>60%</span> also believed that these sightings could be explained by human
        activity or natural phenomenon. For instance, a sighting of moving white lights by dozens of residents in Texas in January 2008, show that even where there is an explanation for sighting 
       (in this case the Air Force confirmed F-16s had been flying in that proximity at the time), non-extra-terrestrial explanations will not always be believed.</p>
